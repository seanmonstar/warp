/// A filter that matches any route.
///
/// This can be a useful building block to build new filters from,
/// since [`Filter`](::Filter) is otherwise a sealed trait.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use warp::Filter;
///
/// let route = warp::any()
///     .map(|| {
///         "I always return this string!"
///     });
/// ```
///
/// This could allow creating a single `impl Filter` returning a specific
/// reply, that can then be used as the end of several different filter
/// chains.
///
/// Another use case is turning some clone-able resource into a `Filter`,
/// thus allowing to easily `and` it together with others.
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use warp::Filter;
///
/// let state = Arc::new(vec![33, 41]);
/// let with_state = warp::any().map(move || state.clone());
///
/// // Now we could `and` with any other filter:
///
/// let route = warp::path::param()
///     .and(with_state)
///     .map(|param_id: u32, db: Arc<Vec<u32>>| {
///         db.contains(&param_id)
///     });
/// ```
