/// chain and reuse them in various parts of your app.
///
/// # Extracting Tuples
///
/// You may notice that several of these filters extract some tuple, often
/// times a tuple of just 1 item! Why?
///
/// If a filter extracts a `(String,)`, that simply means that it
/// extracts a `String`. If you were to `map` the filter, the argument type
/// would be exactly that, just a `String`.
///
/// What is it? It's just some type magic that allows for automatic combining
/// and flattening of tuples. Without it, combining two filters together with
/// `and`, where one extracted `()`, and another `String`, would mean the
/// `map` would be given a single argument of `((), String,)`, which is just
/// no fun.

    ///

    /// filter will simply discard the `()`. If a `Filter` extracts one or
    /// more items, combining will mean it extracts the values of itself

    /// For example, if three `Filter`s were combined together, suppose one
    /// extracts nothing (so `()`), and the other two extract two integers,
    /// a function that accepts exactly two integer arguments is allowed.
    /// Specifically, any `Fn(u32, u32)`.
    ///
    /// Without `Product` and `Func`, this would be a lot messier. First of
    /// all, the `()`s couldn't be discarded, and the tuples would be nested.
    /// So, instead, you'd need to pass an `Fn(((), (u32, u32)))`. That's just
    /// a single argument. Bleck!
    ///
    /// Even worse, the tuples would shuffle the types around depending on
    /// the exact invocation of `and`s. So, `unit.and(int).and(int)` would
    /// result in a different extracted type from `unit.and(int.and(int))`,
    /// or from `int.and(unit).and(int)`. If you changed around the order
    /// of filters, while still having them be semantically equivalent, you'd
    /// need to update all your `map`s as well.
    ///
    /// `Product`, `HList`, and `Func` do all the heavy work so that none of
