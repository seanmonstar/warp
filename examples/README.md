# Examples

Welcome to the examples! These show off `warp`'s functionality and explain how to use it.

## Getting Started

- [`hello.rs`](./hello.rs) - Just a basic "Hello World" API
- [`routing.rs`](./routing.rs) - Builds up a more complex set of routes and shows how to combine filters
- [`body.rs`](./body.rs) - What's a good API without parsing data from the request body?
- [`headers.rs`](./headers.rs) - Parsing data from the request headers
- [`rejections.rs`](./rejections.rs) - Your APIs are obviously perfect, but for silly others who call them incorrectly you'll want to define errors for them
- [`futures.rs`](./futures.rs) - Wait, wait! ... Or how to integrate futures into filters
